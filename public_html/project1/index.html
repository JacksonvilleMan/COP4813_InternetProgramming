        <p>
            Hi! My name is Chris and I was born on January 10, 1997, which makes me 23 years old as of the year 2020. I am a college student trying to find his place in this big world we call home.

        <p>
            An interesting fact about me is that I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webbed_toes" target="_blank" class="personal">webbed toes</a>! 
            Many people ask if they help me swim faster but there's no way I could know that without putting it to the test, which would require me to have non-webbed toes.
